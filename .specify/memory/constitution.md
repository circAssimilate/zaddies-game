# Zaddies Game Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory for all feature development. Tests MUST be written before implementation code, approved by stakeholders, and must fail initially before implementation begins. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced:

1. **Red**: Write failing tests that define desired behavior
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are understood before coding, reduces debugging time, provides living documentation, and enables confident refactoring. For a game project, this prevents regressions in game mechanics, physics, and player interactions.

**Enforcement**:

- All PRs MUST include tests written before implementation
- Tests MUST fail initially (demonstrated in PR description or commit history)
- Code reviews MUST verify TDD compliance
- No exceptions without explicit architectural review and justification

### II. Modular Architecture

All game features and systems MUST be developed as independently testable, loosely coupled modules. Each module MUST have:

- Clear, single responsibility (e.g., physics, rendering, input, game state)
- Well-defined interfaces and contracts
- Independence from other modules (minimal coupling)
- Comprehensive documentation of purpose and API
- Self-contained test suite

**Rationale**: Modular architecture enables parallel development, simplifies testing, allows component reuse, and makes the system maintainable as complexity grows. Games inherently have many independent systems (physics, AI, rendering, audio) that benefit from isolation.

**Prohibited**: Creating "organizational-only" modules that exist solely for code grouping without functional purpose. Avoid tight coupling between game systems that prevents independent testing.

### III. Performance-First

All features MUST meet defined performance benchmarks before merge. Performance is not optional or "nice to have" - it is a core requirement that MUST be validated during development.

**Required Benchmarks** (adjust per game requirements):

- **Frame Rate**: Maintain target FPS (e.g., 60 FPS minimum on target hardware)
- **Latency**: Client-server round-trip < 100ms (p95)
- **Load Time**: Initial game load < 3 seconds
- **Memory**: Stay within memory budget (define per platform)
- **Battery**: Mobile builds MUST be power-efficient (define drain limits)

**Enforcement**:

- Performance tests MUST be included in test suites
- Benchmarks MUST pass in CI/CD pipeline
- Performance regressions block merges
- Profiling data MUST be included for performance-critical features

**Rationale**: Games are performance-sensitive applications where poor performance directly impacts player experience. Addressing performance issues late is costly; building performance awareness from the start prevents technical debt.

### IV. Client-Server Separation

The Zaddies Game architecture MUST maintain clear separation between frontend (client) and backend (server) concerns:

**Frontend Responsibilities**:

- Rendering and visual presentation
- User input handling and local UI state
- Client-side prediction and interpolation
- Asset loading and caching
- Animation and visual effects

**Backend Responsibilities**:

- Authoritative game state and physics
- Player data persistence and validation
- Game logic enforcement (prevent cheating)
- Multiplayer synchronization
- Analytics and telemetry collection

**Contracts**:

- All client-server communication MUST use well-defined API contracts
- API contracts MUST be versioned and documented
- Breaking changes MUST follow semantic versioning rules
- Contract changes require integration tests

**Rationale**: Clear separation prevents client-side manipulation, enables independent scaling, allows frontend/backend teams to work in parallel, and supports multiple client platforms (web, mobile) from a single backend.

### V. Observability & Debuggability

All game systems MUST be observable and debuggable in development and production environments.

**Requirements**:

- **Structured Logging**: All critical game events MUST be logged with structured data (JSON format preferred)
- **Metrics Collection**: Performance metrics, player actions, and system health MUST be instrumented in a way that doesn't cost
- **Error Reporting**: All errors MUST include context (game state, player ID, timestamp, stack trace)
- **Debug Interfaces**: Development builds MUST include debug UI for inspecting game state
- **Cost Conscious**: Keep hosting and service costs in mind - trying to keep the cost footprint as small as possible

**Prohibited**:

- Using tools or platforms that require a subscription
- Silent failures or swallowed errors
- Logging sensitive player data (PII) without consent
- Production builds with debug logging enabled (performance impact)

**Rationale**: Games are complex stateful systems where issues are hard to reproduce. Comprehensive observability enables rapid debugging, understanding player behavior, and data-driven design decisions.

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements

All code changes MUST be reviewed and approved before merge:

1. **Tests First**: Reviewer verifies tests were written before implementation
2. **Constitution Compliance**: Verify adherence to all five core principles
3. **Performance Validation**: Confirm performance benchmarks pass
4. **Documentation**: Ensure module interfaces and contracts are documented
5. **Security**: Check for client-side exploits, data validation issues

### Branch Strategy

- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code only, protected, requires PR + reviews
- **Feature Branches**: Named `###-feature-name` matching spec directory
- **Release Branches**: For coordinated releases and hotfix isolation

### Testing Gates

Before merge, all PRs MUST pass:

1. **Unit Tests**: All module-level tests pass
2. **Integration Tests**: Client-server contract tests pass
3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks meet or exceed targets
4. **Contract Tests**: API compatibility verified
5. **Linting/Formatting**: Code style checks pass

## Quality Gates

### Constitution Check (Required for All Features)

Before implementation begins, features MUST be evaluated against these checks:

1. **TDD Compliance**: Are tests defined and will they be written first?
2. **Modularity**: Can this feature be implemented as independent module(s)?
3. **Performance Impact**: Are performance benchmarks defined and testable?
4. **Architecture Alignment**: Does this respect client-server separation?
5. **Observability**: Are logging, metrics, and debugging hooks planned?

**Complexity Justification**: Any violation of core principles MUST be documented with:

- What principle is being violated and why
- What simpler alternative was considered and why it was rejected
- What technical debt is being created and mitigation plan

### Performance Gate

All features MUST provide performance validation:

- Profiling data showing performance characteristics
- Benchmark test results on target hardware
- Memory usage analysis
- Network bandwidth impact (for multiplayer features)

## Governance

### Amendment Process

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:

1. **Proposal**: Written proposal with rationale and impact analysis
2. **Review**: Technical leadership review and approval
3. **Version Update**: Semantic version bump (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH)
4. **Migration Plan**: For breaking changes, document migration path
5. **Template Updates**: Update all dependent templates and documentation

### Versioning Policy

Constitution versions follow semantic versioning:

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes (principle removal/redefinition)
- **MINOR**: New principles or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic fixes

### Compliance Review

- All pull requests MUST verify constitution compliance
- Complexity and principle violations MUST be justified in PR description
- Quarterly review of constitution effectiveness and potential improvements

### Runtime Development Guidance

For day-to-day development guidance and examples, consult:

- Implementation plans in `/specs/[###-feature]/plan.md`
- Feature specifications in `/specs/[###-feature]/spec.md`
- Task breakdowns in `/specs/[###-feature]/tasks.md`
