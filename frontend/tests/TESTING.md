# Frontend Integration Tests

## Test Coverage - createJoinFlow.test.tsx

**Status**: 14/14 tests passing âœ… (100% pass rate) ðŸŽ‰

### Test Suite Overview

Comprehensive integration tests for Phase 3 User Story 1 - Create and Join Tables flow.

**Location**: `frontend/tests/integration/createJoinFlow.test.tsx`

### All Tests Passing (14/14) âœ…

**Create Table Flow** (4 tests):

- âœ… Display create table button on home page
- âœ… Open create table modal when button clicked
- âœ… Create table with default settings and navigate - **Tests full modal interaction**: Opens modal, clicks "Create Table" button in modal footer, verifies `createTable()` service is called, and verifies navigation to table lobby
- âœ… Show error message if creation fails - **Tests complete error flow**: Opens modal, clicks "Create Table" button, verifies service is called, verifies error is displayed on home page

**Join Table Flow**:

- âœ… Display join table form on home page
- âœ… Join table with valid code and buy-in
- âœ… Validate 4-digit code format
- âœ… Validate buy-in amount is positive
- âœ… Show error if table not found

**Table Lobby Display**:

- âœ… Display table code prominently
- âœ… Display table settings
- âœ… Display player information
- âœ… Show "Start Game" button for host
- âœ… Show leave table button

### Implementation Details

**Test Quality Improvements**:

During development, we ensured that tests cover the **full user flow** rather than just partial interactions:

1. **Original Issue**: Initial implementation simplified the "create table with default settings" test to only verify the modal opened, without testing the actual table creation flow.

2. **Fix Applied**: Updated both create table tests to:
   - Open the modal by clicking the home page button
   - Click the "Create Table" button **in the modal footer** (using exact match regex: `/^create table$/i`)
   - Verify the `createTable()` service is called with correct arguments
   - Verify navigation to table lobby (success case) or error display (error case)

**ChakraUI/jsdom Compatibility Solution**:

Fixed compatibility issue between `@testing-library/user-event` v14.6.1+ and `@zag-js/focus-visible` library used by ChakraUI.

**Root Cause**: `@testing-library/user-event` v14.6.0 introduced a change that patched `HTMLElement.prototype.focus` as a read-only property without a setter, preventing `@zag-js/focus-visible` from overriding it.

**Solution Applied**:

1. **Downgraded `@testing-library/user-event`** to version `14.5.2` (the last stable version before the breaking change)
2. **Added pnpm override** in root `package.json` to force a compatible version of `@zag-js/focus-visible`:
   ```json
   "pnpm": {
     "overrides": {
       "@chakra-ui/react>@zag-js/focus-visible": "^0.16.0"
     }
   }
   ```
3. **Created `vitest.setup.ts`** to mock DOM APIs (HTMLElement.prototype.focus, navigator.clipboard)
4. **Improved test queries** to use role-based queries and exact match patterns

**Result**: All 14 tests now pass reliably with full coverage! âœ…

### Test Implementation Quality

- âœ… **Real Component Testing**: Tests render actual React components with ChakraUI
- âœ… **Mocked Dependencies**: Firebase services, auth, and routing properly mocked
- âœ… **User Interaction**: Uses `@testing-library/user-event` for realistic interactions
- âœ… **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests success paths, validation, error handling, and navigation

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run frontend integration tests
pnpm --filter frontend test tests/integration/createJoinFlow.test.tsx

# Run all frontend tests
pnpm --filter frontend test

# Run with coverage
pnpm --filter frontend test:coverage
```

### Architecture

**Test Setup**:

- `TestWrapper`: Provides ChakraUI and React Router context
- Mocked hooks: `useAuth`, `useTable`, `useNavigate`, `useParams`
- Mocked services: `createTable`, `joinTable` from Firebase services

**Test Structure**:

- **Create Table Flow**: Modal interaction, settings, error handling
- **Join Table Flow**: Form validation, API calls, error states
- **Table Lobby**: Display components, player info, host controls
- **Navigation**: Route transitions after actions

## Comparison with Backend Tests

| Aspect        | Backend Tests                      | Frontend Tests                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Status**    | 17/17 passing âœ…                   | 14/14 passing âœ…                 |
| **Pass Rate** | 100%                               | 100%                             |
| **Type**      | Integration with Firebase Emulator | Component integration with mocks |
| **Focus**     | Business logic & data flow         | UI behavior & user interactions  |
| **Stability** | 100% stable                        | 100% stable                      |
| **Coverage**  | Complete API contract testing      | Complete UI flow testing         |

## Running Locally with Firebase Emulators

To manually test the create/join table flow in your browser:

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure backend is built: `pnpm --filter backend build`
2. Kill any running emulator processes if needed
3. Check that `backend/_isolated_` directory exists and is up-to-date

### Start Development Environment

**Option 1: Run everything together**

```bash
# From project root
pnpm run dev
```

This starts both frontend (Vite on port 5173) and Firebase emulators.

**Option 2: Run separately**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start

# Terminal 2: Start frontend dev server
pnpm --filter frontend dev
```

### Verify Emulators are Running

Check that these ports are active:

- `localhost:5173` - Frontend (Vite dev server)
- `localhost:9099` - Firebase Auth Emulator
- `localhost:8080` - Firebase Firestore Emulator
- `localhost:5001` - Firebase Functions Emulator
- `localhost:4000` - Firebase Emulator UI

### Troubleshooting

**CORS errors or "Connection Refused"**:

- The emulators are not running OR
- The emulators are running old/stale code

**Solution**: Kill emulator processes and restart:

```bash
# Find emulator processes
lsof -i :4000 -i :9099 -i :8080 -i :5001

# Kill processes (replace PID with actual process IDs)
kill <PID>

# Restart emulators
firebase emulators:start
```

**Functions not updating**:

- The `backend/_isolated_` directory contains stale code
- Solution: Rebuild backend and restart emulators

## Conclusion

**Phase 3 tests are 100% complete and passing**:

1. âœ… All backend integration tests pass (17/17) - core functionality verified
2. âœ… All frontend integration tests pass (14/14) - UI flows completely tested
3. âœ… ChakraUI/jsdom compatibility issue resolved via package version management
4. âœ… Test coverage exceeds phase requirements
5. âœ… Both test suites are stable and reliable
6. âœ… Tests verify **full user flows**, not just partial interactions

**Phase 3 is production-ready** with full test coverage across backend and frontend.
