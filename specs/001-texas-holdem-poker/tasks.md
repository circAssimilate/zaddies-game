# Tasks: Texas Hold'em Poker Game

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-texas-holdem-poker/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The project uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) as mandated by the constitution. Tests MUST be written before implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Web app structure**: `frontend/src/` and `backend/src/`
- Frontend uses Vite + React + TypeScript + Chakra UI
- Backend uses Firebase Functions + TypeScript
- Tests in respective `tests/` directories

T058 includes 14 tests with 14/14 passing (100%) - tests cover create table flow, join table flow, and table lobby display. ChakraUI/jsdom compatibility resolved by downgrading @testing-library/user-event to 14.5.2.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 (table creation) but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses table/hand state from US1/US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses hand completion from US2 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Schemas/types before functions
- Backend functions before frontend components
- Hooks before components that use them
- Core implementation before UI polish
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models/schemas within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task T056: "Write contract test for createTable function"
Task T057: "Write contract test for joinTable function"
Task T058: "Write integration test for table creation flow"

# Launch all schemas for User Story 1 together:
Task T059: "Create Player Firestore collection schema"
Task T060: "Create Table Firestore collection schema"

# Launch all frontend components for User Story 1 together (after hooks):
Task T067: "Create Home page component"
Task T068: "Create TableLobby page component"
Task T069: "Implement CreateTableModal component"
Task T070: "Implement JoinTableForm component"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Create/Join Tables)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Play Hands)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test both stories work together
6. Deploy MVP for friend group testing

**MVP Delivers**: Functional poker game for 2-10 players with Vegas rules, manual chip tracking

### Incremental Delivery

1. MVP (US1 + US2) ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Test with friends
2. Add User Story 3 (Cashier) ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Test ledger tracking
3. Add User Story 4 (Settings) ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Test customization
4. Add User Story 5 (Shareable Views) ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Test streaming
5. Add User Story 6 (Hand History) ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Test transparency
6. Polish (Phase 9) ‚Üí Final Deploy

Each increment adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Create/Join)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Play Hands)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Cashier)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. Team tackles User Stories 4-6 in priority order
5. Final team effort on Polish phase

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD**: Verify tests fail before implementing (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---

## Total Task Count

- **Setup**: 28 tasks
- **Foundational**: 27 tasks
- **User Story 1**: 20 tasks
- **User Story 2**: 30 tasks
- **User Story 3**: 21 tasks
- **User Story 4**: 13 tasks
- **User Story 5**: 13 tasks
- **User Story 6**: 13 tasks
- **Polish**: 20 tasks

**Total**: 185 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 78 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
**MVP Scope**: Setup + Foundational + US1 + US2 = 105 tasks (~57% of total)
