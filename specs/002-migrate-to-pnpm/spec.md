# Feature Specification: Package Manager Migration to pnpm

**Feature Branch**: `002-migrate-to-pnpm`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Migrating from npm to pnpm."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-26

- Q: How should the system prevent use of npm commands after migration? → A: Use `.npmrc` with `engine-strict=true` and `package.json` engines field to block npm, allowing graceful error messages
- Q: What is the rollback strategy if critical issues arise post-migration? → A: No rollback plan - migration is permanent and irreversible once merged
- Q: Where should dependency installation time metrics be reported for performance monitoring? → A: Log to GitHub Actions job summary with time measurement in workflow output

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - CI/CD Pipeline Efficiency (Priority: P1)

The continuous integration and deployment pipelines need to install dependencies quickly to provide fast feedback on code changes and enable rapid deployment.

**Why this priority**: CI/CD pipeline speed directly impacts developer velocity and deployment frequency. Slow dependency installation blocks all downstream CI tasks (linting, testing, building) and delays feedback to developers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by triggering CI and deployment workflows, measuring dependency installation time, and verifying it's reduced by at least 50% compared to npm (from ~60s to ~20s with cache, ~90s to ~30s without cache).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a pull request is opened with no dependency changes, **When** CI runs, **Then** dependencies are installed in under 20 seconds using cached packages
2. **Given** the lockfile has changed, **When** CI runs, **Then** only changed dependencies are downloaded and total installation completes in under 45 seconds
3. **Given** deployment workflow is triggered with no cache, **When** dependencies are installed, **Then** installation completes in under 30 seconds
4. **Given** deployment workflow runs with existing cache, **When** dependencies are installed, **Then** installation completes in under 15 seconds
5. **Given** multiple CI jobs run in parallel, **When** each installs dependencies, **Then** cache is effectively shared and all jobs benefit from reduced installation time

### User Story 2 - Developer Dependency Installation (Priority: P2)

Developers need to install project dependencies quickly and reliably when setting up their development environment or after pulling changes.

**Why this priority**: While important for developer experience, local development installation is less frequent than CI/CD runs and developers can work with existing dependencies while background installation completes.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by cloning the repository fresh, running the install command, and verifying all dependencies are correctly installed in under 30 seconds, with the project building successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer clones the repository for the first time, **When** they run the install command, **Then** all dependencies are installed correctly in under 30 seconds
2. **Given** dependencies have been updated in the lockfile, **When** a developer pulls changes and runs install, **Then** only changed dependencies are downloaded and installed
3. **Given** a developer has an existing node_modules folder, **When** they run a clean install, **Then** the installation completes successfully without conflicts
4. **Given** a developer switches branches with different dependencies, **When** they run install, **Then** dependencies are updated correctly without manual cleanup

---

### User Story 3 - Workspace Management (Priority: P3)

Developers working in the monorepo need efficient workspace dependency management across frontend, backend, and shared packages.

**Why this priority**: While important for monorepo structure, workspace operations are less frequent than basic installation and have workarounds if issues arise.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a new dependency to one workspace, running the workspace-specific install command, and verifying the dependency is correctly linked across the monorepo with reduced disk usage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer adds a dependency to the frontend workspace, **When** they run a workspace install, **Then** the dependency is installed only for frontend and properly linked
2. **Given** a shared package is updated, **When** a developer rebuilds, **Then** all dependent workspaces reference the updated version
3. **Given** a developer runs tests in a specific workspace, **When** they execute the workspace test command, **Then** only that workspace's tests run with correct dependencies
4. **Given** the monorepo has shared dependencies across workspaces, **When** dependencies are installed, **Then** disk space usage is reduced by at least 30% compared to npm through deduplication

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer has both npm and pnpm installed globally and tries to use the wrong command?
- What happens when the lockfile is corrupted or conflicts during a merge?
- How does the system handle platform-specific dependencies (Windows vs macOS vs Linux)?
- What happens when a dependency is installed globally vs locally?
- How does the system behave when disk space is insufficient during installation?
- What happens when CI cache becomes corrupted or invalid?
- How does the system handle dependency installation failures in CI (retry logic, fallback)?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: CI/CD pipelines MUST install dependencies using pnpm instead of npm
- **FR-002**: CI/CD pipelines MUST cache pnpm store to achieve sub-20-second installation times on cache hits
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain a pnpm lockfile (pnpm-lock.yaml) that ensures reproducible builds
- **FR-004**: CI/CD workflows MUST measure and report dependency installation time to GitHub Actions job summary for performance monitoring and validation of 50% improvement target
- **FR-005**: Deployment workflows MUST install dependencies in under 30 seconds (no cache) or 15 seconds (with cache)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support workspace management for monorepo structure (frontend, backend, shared)
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST reflect pnpm commands in all developer setup, CI/CD, and deployment instructions
- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent use of npm commands after migration using `.npmrc` with `engine-strict=true` and `package.json` engines field specifying pnpm, providing graceful error messages when npm is attempted
- **FR-009**: All build scripts MUST work identically with pnpm as they did with npm
- **FR-010**: All test scripts MUST work identically with pnpm as they did with npm
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve all existing dependency versions during migration (no version changes)
- **FR-012**: CI/CD pipelines MUST fail fast if pnpm installation fails and provide clear error messaging
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate that migration reduces CI dependency installation time by at least 50%
- **FR-014**: Developers MUST be able to install dependencies with a single command (pnpm install)

### Key Entities

- **Package Manager Configuration**: Settings that control how dependencies are installed, cached, and resolved (workspace configuration, store location, lockfile format, cache policy)
- **Dependency Lockfile**: Record of exact dependency versions and their resolution metadata to ensure reproducible installations across all environments
- **Workspace**: Individual package within the monorepo (frontend, backend, shared) with its own dependencies and scripts
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated build and test workflow that installs dependencies, runs quality checks, and measures performance
- **Cache Store**: Persistent storage of downloaded packages that can be reused across builds to accelerate installation

## Assumptions _(mandatory)_

1. **Package Manager Compatibility**: Assuming pnpm is compatible with all existing dependencies and there are no package-specific issues that require npm
2. **Team Adoption**: Assuming all developers are willing to install and use pnpm instead of npm
3. **CI/CD Infrastructure**: Assuming the CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions) supports pnpm caching and installation with actions/setup-node and pnpm/action-setup
4. **Dependency Resolution**: Assuming pnpm's stricter dependency resolution won't break existing code that relies on phantom dependencies
5. **Global Installation**: Assuming developers can install pnpm globally or the project can provide local installation instructions
6. **Lockfile Migration**: Assuming pnpm's import command successfully converts npm's package-lock.json to pnpm-lock.yaml
7. **Workspace Support**: Assuming pnpm's workspace features are compatible with npm workspace configuration
8. **Build Tool Integration**: Assuming all build tools (Vite, TypeScript, Vitest, Firebase) work correctly with pnpm
9. **Version Requirement**: Assuming pnpm version 8.x or higher is acceptable for the project
10. **Backwards Compatibility**: Migration is permanent and irreversible once merged to main - no rollback to npm is supported
11. **Cache Storage**: Assuming CI/CD runners have sufficient disk space for pnpm cache storage (typically 500MB-1GB)
12. **Performance Baseline**: Assuming current npm installation times in CI are approximately 60 seconds (cached) and 90 seconds (uncached) based on recent observations
