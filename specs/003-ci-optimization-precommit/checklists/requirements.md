# Specification Quality Checklist: CI/CD Optimization and Pre-commit Quality Checks

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Validation Date**: 2025-10-25

### Content Quality Assessment

- ✅ Specification avoids implementation details - focuses on behaviors and outcomes
- ✅ Success criteria are framed in user-facing terms (developer experience, CI time reduction)
- ✅ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

- ✅ No clarification markers present - all requirements are explicit
- ✅ Each functional requirement is testable (e.g., "MUST block commits when checks fail")
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (90% error catch rate, 60s max duration, 30% resource reduction)
- ✅ All user stories have acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases cover key scenarios (timeouts, bypassing hooks, file categorization errors)
- ✅ Out of Scope section clearly bounds the feature
- ✅ Assumptions section documents environmental and tooling expectations

### Feature Readiness Assessment

- ✅ Functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ Three prioritized user stories cover independent, testable value slices
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable and aligned with user story outcomes
- ✅ Specification maintains abstraction - no mention of specific tools/frameworks in requirements

## Status

**Overall Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items validated successfully. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

## Next Steps

1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. OR use `/speckit.clarify` if additional clarifications are needed based on stakeholder feedback
