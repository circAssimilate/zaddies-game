# Implementation Plan: CI/CD Optimization and Pre-commit Quality Checks

**Branch**: `003-ci-optimization-precommit` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-ci-optimization-precommit/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature implements two complementary optimizations to improve developer experience and reduce CI/CD resource usage:

1. **Pre-commit Quality Gates**: Automatically run Prettier formatting, ESLint, and TypeScript compilation checks before allowing commits, catching issues locally before they reach CI
2. **Intelligent CI Workflow Optimization**: Modify GitHub Actions workflows to selectively run build and deployment steps based on changed file types, skipping expensive operations when only documentation changes

The primary goal is to reduce failed CI builds by 80% and decrease CI resource usage by 30% while maintaining code quality standards.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.3+, Node.js 20 LTS
**Primary Dependencies**:

- Git hooks: NEEDS CLARIFICATION (Husky vs lint-staged vs simple-git-hooks)
- Prettier 3.0.0 (already in project)
- ESLint 8.50.0 with TypeScript plugin (already in project)
- GitHub Actions (existing CI/CD platform)

**Storage**: N/A (workflow configuration and hook scripts only)
**Testing**: Existing test frameworks (Jest/Vitest) - no new testing tools needed
**Target Platform**: Developer workstations (macOS, Linux, Windows) + GitHub Actions runners (Ubuntu)
**Project Type**: Web application (monorepo with frontend/backend/shared packages)
**Performance Goals**:

- Pre-commit checks complete in <60 seconds for typical commits
- Documentation-only CI runs complete in <2 minutes
- Zero impact on commit performance when hooks are bypassed

**Constraints**:

- Must work across all developer platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Must not break existing git workflows or IDE integrations
- Must be installable automatically (no manual setup steps)
- Hook scripts must handle edge cases gracefully (crashes, timeouts)

**Scale/Scope**:

- Current codebase: ~5,000 LOC across frontend/backend/shared
- Typical commit: 5-50 files changed
- Team size: Small (2-5 developers)
- CI workflow modifications: 2 files (.github/workflows/ci.yml, deploy.yml)

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### 1. TDD Compliance ✅ PASS

**Status**: PASS (with justification)

**Justification**: This feature is primarily tooling and configuration (pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions workflow modifications). Testing approach:

- Pre-commit hooks: Integration tests that verify hooks run and block commits with errors
- CI workflow logic: Test file categorization logic with unit tests for path matching
- End-to-end validation: Manually verify hooks install correctly and CI skips appropriate steps

TDD applies where logic exists (file categorization), but infrastructure configuration (hook installation, workflow YAML) is validated through integration tests rather than pure unit tests.

### 2. Modular Architecture ✅ PASS

**Status**: PASS

**Analysis**:

- Pre-commit hook system is independent module (hook scripts, installation logic)
- CI workflow modifications are isolated to GitHub Actions YAML files
- File categorization logic can be extracted as standalone utility function
- Each component (formatter, linter, type checker) runs independently
- No coupling between pre-commit hooks and CI workflow optimization

### 3. Performance-First ✅ PASS

**Status**: PASS

**Performance Benchmarks Defined**:

- Pre-commit checks complete in <60 seconds (SC-002)
- Documentation-only CI runs complete in <2 minutes (SC-003)
- CI resource usage decreases by 30% (SC-004)
- 95% of commits pass checks on first attempt (SC-007 - implies fast feedback)

**Validation Plan**: Performance tests will measure hook execution time and CI duration, blocking merge if benchmarks fail.

### 4. Architecture Alignment (Client-Server Separation) ✅ PASS

**Status**: PASS (N/A - infrastructure feature)

**Analysis**: This feature operates at the development tooling layer, not application architecture layer. No client-server concerns apply to git hooks or CI workflows.

### 5. Observability & Debuggability ✅ PASS

**Status**: PASS

**Observability**:

- Pre-commit hooks must output clear error messages (FR-005, SC-006)
- CI workflows must log which steps were run/skipped (FR-011)
- Hook execution can include timing information for debugging slow checks
- No PII concerns (only code paths and error messages)
- Zero subscription costs (uses existing GitHub Actions, git hooks, npm packages)

### 6. Mobile-First UI Design ✅ PASS

**Status**: PASS (N/A - infrastructure feature)

**Analysis**: This feature has no UI components. No mobile-first design requirements apply.

### 7. Universal Accessibility ✅ PASS

**Status**: PASS (N/A - infrastructure feature)

**Analysis**: This feature has no UI components. No accessibility requirements apply.

### 8. ADR Documentation ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION

**Status**: REQUIRES ADR

**Architectural Decisions Requiring Documentation**:

1. **Choice of git hook framework** (Husky vs lint-staged vs simple-git-hooks) - affects developer setup, cross-platform compatibility, and maintenance
2. **File categorization strategy** for CI workflow optimization - defines which file patterns trigger which CI steps
3. **Pre-commit check sequencing** - why Prettier runs before linting/type checking (auto-formatting reduces false errors)

**Action**: Create ADR 005 documenting git hook framework selection after Phase 0 research completes.

### Constitution Check Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PASS** (ADR required during implementation)

All applicable principles pass. ADR 005 must be created to document git hook framework choice and file categorization strategy before implementation begins.

## Constitution Check Re-evaluation (Post-Design)

_Re-checked after Phase 1 design completion (data model, contracts, quickstart)_

### Design Validation

✅ **TDD Compliance**: Contracts define testable interfaces, testing approach clarified in data-model.md
✅ **Modular Architecture**: File categorization and pre-commit check APIs are independent modules with clear contracts
✅ **Performance-First**: Performance benchmarks documented in quickstart.md, validation approach defined
✅ **Observability**: Check results include structured output, workflow decisions logged (per contracts)
✅ **ADR Requirement**: research.md documents ADR 005 specification

**No new violations introduced during design phase.**

**Proceeding to Phase 2 (Tasks Generation)**: All gates pass, ready for `/speckit.tasks`

**Structure Decision**: Web application monorepo structure (existing). This feature adds:

1. Git hook framework integration (directory TBD based on research: .husky/ vs .git-hooks/)
2. Shared utility script for file categorization logic
3. Modifications to existing CI/CD workflow files
4. Package.json scripts for hook installation and pre-commit checks
