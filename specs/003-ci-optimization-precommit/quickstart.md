# Quick Start: CI/CD Optimization and Pre-commit Quality Checks

**Feature**: 003-ci-optimization-precommit
**For**: Developers setting up or using pre-commit hooks and optimized CI workflows
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25

## What This Feature Does

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatically run Prettier, ESLint, and TypeScript checks before allowing commits, catching issues locally
2. **Smart CI Workflows**: Skip unnecessary build and deployment steps when only documentation changes, reducing CI time and costs

## For Developers: First-Time Setup

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

Pre-commit hooks install automatically when you run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

The `prepare` script in `package.json` runs `husky install` automatically, setting up git hooks for you.

**Verify Installation**:

```bash
# Check that hooks are installed
ls -la .husky/
# Should see: pre-commit

# Hooks should be executable
test -x .husky/pre-commit && echo "‚úÖ Hook is executable" || echo "‚ùå Hook not executable"
```

### Manual Installation (If Needed)

If hooks didn't install automatically:

```bash
# Install Husky hooks
pnpm run prepare

# Or directly:
pnpm exec husky install
```

---

## For Developers: Daily Usage

### Making a Commit (Normal Flow)

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add src/components/NewComponent.tsx

# Commit (pre-commit checks run automatically)
git commit -m "feat: add new component"
```

**What Happens**:

1. Prettier formats your staged files (auto-fixes)
2. ESLint checks for code quality issues
3. TypeScript compiler checks for type errors
4. If all pass: Commit succeeds ‚úÖ
5. If any fail: Commit blocked ‚ùå (you'll see error details)

**Expected Time**: 10-45 seconds (depending on how many files changed)

### Understanding Check Failures

If your commit is blocked, you'll see output like:

```
‚ùå Pre-commit checks failed

‚úÖ Prettier - PASSED (2.3s)
‚ùå ESLint - FAILED (5.1s)
   src/components/NewComponent.tsx:15:7
   'userName' is defined but never used  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars

‚ùå TypeScript - FAILED (18.2s)
   src/components/NewComponent.tsx:20:5
   Property 'onClick' does not exist on type 'ButtonProps'

üö´ Commit blocked - fix errors and try again
```

**Fix the errors**, then commit again. The checks will re-run.

### Bypassing Checks (Emergency Only)

If you need to commit urgently without running checks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: hotfix for production"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use sparingly** - bypassed commits will still fail in CI if they have errors.

## For Developers: Troubleshooting

### "Husky command not found"

**Cause**: Husky not installed or not in PATH

**Fix**:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm exec husky install
```

### "Checks taking too long" (>60 seconds)

**Cause**: TypeScript compilation slow on large projects

**Temporary Workaround**:

```bash
# Skip TypeScript check just for this commit
SKIP_TSC=1 git commit -m "your message"
```

**Long-term Fix**: Optimize tsconfig.json (incremental compilation, project references)

### "Permission denied: .husky/pre-commit"

**Cause**: Hook script not executable

**Fix**:

```bash
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
```

### "lint-staged: command not found"

**Cause**: Dependencies not installed

**Fix**:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## For CI/CD: How Optimized Workflows Work

### Documentation-Only Changes

**Scenario**: You only modify `README.md` or files in `docs/`

**Old Behavior**: Full CI pipeline runs (5+ minutes)

**New Behavior**:

- ‚úÖ Linting runs (markdown linting if configured)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Tests skipped
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Build skipped
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Deployment skipped
- ‚è±Ô∏è Total time: <2 minutes

**How to Verify**:

1. Make a documentation-only change
2. Push to a PR
3. Check GitHub Actions workflow logs
4. Look for "Skipping build - documentation-only changes" messages

### Source Code Changes

**Scenario**: You modify any `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, or `.jsx` file

**Behavior**: Full CI pipeline runs (all checks, build, deployment)

### Test-Only Changes

**Scenario**: You only modify test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)

**Behavior**:

- ‚úÖ Linting runs
- ‚úÖ Tests run
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Build skipped (optional optimization)
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Deployment skipped

## For Contributors: Running Checks Manually

### Run All Pre-commit Checks

```bash
# Same checks that run during git commit
pnpm run precommit
```

### Run Individual Checks

```bash
# Just Prettier
pnpm run format

# Just ESLint
pnpm run lint

# Just TypeScript
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit
```

### Run Checks on Specific Files

```bash
# Format specific files
pnpm exec prettier --write src/components/Button.tsx

# Lint specific files
pnpm exec eslint src/components/Button.tsx

# TypeScript always checks entire project (can't isolate single file)
```

---

## Configuration Files

### Husky Configuration

**File**: `.husky/pre-commit`

**Contents**:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

pnpm exec lint-staged && pnpm run type-check
```

**Modify**: Edit this file to change which commands run during pre-commit

### lint-staged Configuration

**File**: `package.json` (or `.lintstagedrc.json`)

**Contents**:

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}": ["prettier --write", "eslint --fix"]
  }
}
```

**Modify**: Edit to change which commands run on staged files

### File Categorization Patterns

**File**: `scripts/categorize-files.js` (or embedded in GitHub Actions)

**Purpose**: Define which file patterns belong to which categories

**Modify**: Edit patterns if you add new directories or file types

## Performance Expectations

| Check               | Typical Time  | Maximum Allowed |
| ------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Prettier            | 1-5 seconds   | 10 seconds      |
| ESLint              | 2-10 seconds  | 20 seconds      |
| TypeScript          | 10-30 seconds | 40 seconds      |
| **Total (typical)** | 13-45 seconds | 60 seconds      |

If checks consistently exceed maximums, file a performance bug report.

## Success Metrics

After this feature is implemented, we expect:

- ‚úÖ 90% of errors caught locally before CI runs (SC-001)
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit checks complete in <60 seconds (SC-002)
- ‚úÖ Documentation-only CI runs in <2 minutes (SC-003)
- ‚úÖ 80% fewer failed CI builds due to formatting/linting/types (SC-005)
- ‚úÖ 95% of commits pass checks on first attempt (SC-007)

## Getting Help

**Pre-commit hook issues**:

- Check that Husky is installed: `pnpm list husky`
- Verify hook is executable: `ls -la .husky/pre-commit`
- Try manual install: `pnpm run prepare`

**CI workflow issues**:

- Check GitHub Actions logs for "Skipping X step" messages
- Verify file categorization is correct (see workflow decision logs)
- Ensure workflows are using latest version from main branch

**Performance issues**:

- Profile TypeScript compilation: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit --diagnostics`
- Check for large file counts: `git diff --cached --name-only | wc -l`
- Consider `--no-verify` for very large commits (then fix in separate commit)

---

## Next Steps

1. **After Setup**: Make a test commit to verify hooks work
2. **For New Features**: Pre-commit checks should catch issues before pushing
3. **For Reviews**: Expect fewer CI failures from formatting/linting/types
4. **For Maintenance**: Periodically review check performance and adjust patterns
