# Feature Specification: CI/CD Optimization and Pre-commit Quality Checks

**Feature Branch**: `003-ci-optimization-precommit`
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We should only run CI and deploy action steps when files are changed that impact the app - for instance, documentation should not require a deploy. We should create a pre-commit hook that runs prettier, then lint, then the typescript compiler across the entire project so we can get ahead of CI and deploy failures."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Developer Commits Code Without Breaking CI (Priority: P1)

A developer makes changes to application code and commits. Before the commit completes, automated quality checks (formatting, linting, type checking) run locally and catch issues immediately, allowing the developer to fix problems before they reach CI.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - preventing broken builds from reaching CI saves time, reduces context switching, and improves developer experience. It's the foundation that makes all other optimizations valuable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a commit with intentional code quality issues (formatting errors, lint violations, type errors) and verifying the commit is blocked with clear error messages. Success is when issues are caught locally before CI runs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has modified TypeScript files with formatting issues, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** Prettier automatically formats the files before linting and type checking proceed
2. **Given** a developer has modified code with linting errors, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** the commit is blocked and specific linting errors are displayed
3. **Given** a developer has modified code with TypeScript compilation errors, **When** they attempt to commit, **Then** the commit is blocked and specific type errors are displayed
4. **Given** a developer has made changes that pass all pre-commit checks, **When** they commit, **Then** the commit completes successfully without manual intervention

### User Story 2 - Documentation Changes Skip Deployment (Priority: P2)

A developer updates documentation files (README, markdown docs, etc.) and pushes changes. The CI system runs only documentation-relevant checks (linting, link validation) and skips expensive build and deployment steps, reducing CI time and resource usage.

**Why this priority**: This delivers immediate cost savings and faster feedback for documentation changes, but depends on having P1's quality checks working first to ensure code quality isn't compromised when skipping certain CI steps.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by committing only documentation changes and verifying that CI runs complete in under 2 minutes without executing build or deployment steps. Logs should clearly show which steps were skipped and why.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has only modified markdown documentation files, **When** they push changes, **Then** CI skips build and deployment steps
2. **Given** a developer has only modified markdown documentation files, **When** they push changes, **Then** CI completes in under 2 minutes
3. **Given** a developer has modified both code and documentation files, **When** they push changes, **Then** CI runs full build and deployment pipeline
4. **Given** a developer has modified configuration files that affect the build, **When** they push changes, **Then** CI runs full build and deployment pipeline even if documentation was also changed

---

### User Story 3 - Selective CI Based on Changed Files (Priority: P3)

A developer makes changes to specific parts of the codebase (e.g., only frontend code, only backend code, only tests). The CI system intelligently runs only the relevant test suites and build steps based on what files changed, reducing overall CI execution time.

**Why this priority**: This provides further optimization but requires P1 and P2 to be working first. It's valuable for larger projects but adds complexity in determining dependencies between code areas.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making isolated changes to different code areas and verifying that only relevant CI steps execute. For example, frontend-only changes should skip backend tests.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has only modified frontend code, **When** they push changes, **Then** CI runs frontend tests and build but skips backend-specific steps
2. **Given** a developer has only modified test files, **When** they push changes, **Then** CI runs the relevant test suites but skips deployment
3. **Given** a developer has modified core shared code, **When** they push changes, **Then** CI runs full test suite and deployment pipeline
4. **Given** a developer has only modified GitHub Actions workflow files, **When** they push changes, **Then** CI runs workflow validation but may skip standard build steps

### Edge Cases

- What happens when pre-commit checks take longer than 30 seconds? (timeout handling, progress indicators)
- How does the system handle when a developer bypasses pre-commit hooks using `--no-verify`?
- What happens when CI file path detection incorrectly categorizes a file change?
- How does the system handle changes to the pre-commit hook configuration itself?
- What happens when Prettier, linter, or TypeScript compiler crashes during pre-commit?
- How does the system handle incomplete or partial commits (staged vs unstaged changes)?
- What happens when CI skips deployment but deployment configuration has changed?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST run Prettier code formatting before linting and type checking during pre-commit
- **FR-002**: System MUST run linting checks on all staged files during pre-commit
- **FR-003**: System MUST run TypeScript compilation checks on the entire project during pre-commit
- **FR-004**: System MUST block commits when any pre-commit check fails
- **FR-005**: System MUST display clear, actionable error messages when pre-commit checks fail
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically format files with Prettier before running other checks
- **FR-007**: System MUST detect changed files in CI and determine which workflow steps are required
- **FR-008**: System MUST skip build steps when only documentation files have changed
- **FR-009**: System MUST skip deployment steps when only documentation files have changed
- **FR-010**: System MUST run full CI pipeline when any application code, configuration, or dependency files change
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve CI logs indicating which steps were run and which were skipped
- **FR-012**: System MUST categorize file types (documentation, code, configuration, tests) accurately
- **FR-013**: Pre-commit hooks MUST be automatically installed during project setup
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow developers to bypass pre-commit checks with explicit flag for emergency situations
- **FR-015**: System MUST run pre-commit checks only on staged files, not all modified files

### Key Entities

- **File Change Set**: Collection of files modified in a commit or push, categorized by type (documentation, source code, configuration, tests, workflows)
- **Pre-commit Check**: Individual validation step (formatting, linting, type checking) with pass/fail status and error output
- **CI Workflow Step**: Individual CI job or step with execution conditions based on changed files
- **Check Result**: Outcome of a validation with status, duration, and error details

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers catch 90% of formatting, linting, and type errors locally before pushing to CI
- **SC-002**: Pre-commit checks complete in under 60 seconds for typical commits (under 50 files changed)
- **SC-003**: Documentation-only changes complete CI in under 2 minutes (compared to 5+ minutes for full pipeline)
- **SC-004**: CI resource usage (compute time, runner minutes) decreases by 30% within first month of deployment
- **SC-005**: Failed CI builds due to formatting, linting, or type errors decrease by 80%
- **SC-006**: Developers can identify why a commit was blocked within 10 seconds of seeing the error message
- **SC-007**: 95% of commits pass pre-commit checks on first attempt after initial developer adjustment period (2 weeks)
- **SC-008**: CI correctly identifies file change categories with 99% accuracy (no false skips of required steps)

## Out of Scope

- Running full test suites during pre-commit (only type checking, not runtime tests)
- Automatic fixing of linting errors beyond formatting
- Custom pre-commit hook configuration per developer
- Optimizing CI for other criteria beyond file changes (e.g., branch-based rules)
- Integration with external CI/CD platforms beyond current GitHub Actions setup

## Assumptions

- Developers have local development environments with necessary tools installed (Node.js, pnpm, TypeScript)
- Pre-commit hooks will be installed automatically via package.json scripts or similar mechanism
- Current CI system is GitHub Actions (for implementation phase, but spec remains platform-agnostic)
- Project uses standard tools: Prettier for formatting, ESLint for linting, TypeScript compiler for type checking
- Typical commit size is under 50 files changed
- Full CI pipeline currently takes 5+ minutes to complete
- Documentation files are primarily markdown files in docs/ directories or README files
- Developers have sufficient local machine resources to run checks without significant performance degradation
