# Tasks: CI/CD Optimization and Pre-commit Quality Checks (v2 Simplified)

**Implementation**: v2 simplified approach using GitHub Actions native `paths` filtering
**Status**: All tasks completed
**Branch**: `003-ci-optimization-precommit`

## Implementation Overview

This feature was implemented using a simplified v2 approach after discovering that GitHub Actions provides native `paths` and `paths-ignore` filtering, eliminating the need for custom file categorization logic.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Pre-commit Hooks Setup

- [x] T001: Install Husky and lint-staged dependencies in root package.json
- [x] T002: Add Husky prepare script to root package.json
- [x] T003: Add lint-staged configuration to root package.json (Prettier + ESLint on staged files)
- [x] T004: Add type-check script to root package.json (pnpm -r exec tsc --noEmit)
- [x] T005: Initialize Husky hooks directory using pnpm exec husky install
- [x] T006: Create pre-commit hook script in .husky/pre-commit
- [x] T007: Configure pre-commit to run lint-staged then type-check
- [x] T008: Make pre-commit hook executable (chmod +x .husky/pre-commit)
- [x] T009: Test pre-commit hooks with intentional errors (formatting, lint, types)
- [x] T010: Verify hook auto-installation via prepare script works

### Phase 2: GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization (v2 Simplified)

- [x] T011: Create .github/workflows/lint.yml with paths-ignore for docs
- [x] T012: Create .github/workflows/frontend.yml with paths filter for frontend/** and shared/**
- [x] T013: Create .github/workflows/backend.yml with paths filter for backend/** and shared/**
- [x] T014: Update .github/workflows/deploy.yml with paths-ignore for docs-only changes
- [x] T015: Delete old .github/workflows/ci.yml (replaced by separate workflows)
- [x] T016: Verify lint workflow triggers on non-docs PRs
- [x] T017: Verify frontend workflow triggers only on frontend/shared changes
- [x] T018: Verify backend workflow triggers only on backend/shared changes
- [x] T019: Verify deploy workflow skips on docs-only changes

### Phase 3: Documentation

- [x] T020: Create ADR 005 documenting pre-commit hooks and CI optimization decision
- [x] T021: Update ADR 005 with v2 simplified approach (mark v1 as SUPERSEDED)
- [x] T022: Create plan.md documenting v2 implementation approach
- [x] T023: Create spec.md with user stories and requirements
- [x] T024: Create research.md documenting technology choices (Husky vs alternatives)
- [x] T025: Create quickstart.md with developer setup and troubleshooting guide
- [x] T026: Update quickstart.md to explain GitHub Actions paths filtering (v2)
- [x] T027: Update spec.md to reference paths filtering instead of custom logic (v2)

### Phase 4: Cleanup (v1 to v2 Migration)

- [x] T028: Delete scripts/categorize-files.ts (custom categorization engine - no longer needed)
- [x] T029: Delete scripts/**tests**/categorize-files.test.ts (tests for deleted engine)
- [x] T030: Delete scripts/get-changed-files.sh (bash helper - no longer needed)
- [x] T031: Delete shared/src/types/file-categorization.ts (types for deleted engine)
- [x] T032: Delete shared/src/types/precommit-checks.ts (types for deleted engine)
- [x] T033: Delete specs/003-ci-optimization-precommit/data-model.md (documented v1 approach)
- [x] T034: Delete specs/003-ci-optimization-precommit/contracts/ (API contracts for v1)
- [x] T035: Delete specs/003-ci-optimization-precommit/checklists/ (v1 checklist)

## Key Decisions

### Why v2 Instead of v1?

Initial implementation (v1) created ~4,000 lines of custom file categorization logic, unit tests, type definitions, and bash scripting. After review, we discovered GitHub Actions already provides `paths` and `paths-ignore` filtering natively.

**v2 Benefits**:

- 96% less code (4000 lines → 165 lines)
- Zero custom logic to maintain
- Platform-maintained feature (GitHub maintains it, not us)
- Simpler and easier to understand
- Same functionality and performance

See ADR 005 for full decision rationale.

## File Changes Summary

### Files Added (v2 Implementation)

- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` (38 lines) - Lint workflow with paths-ignore
- `.github/workflows/frontend.yml` (36 lines) - Frontend tests/build with paths filter
- `.github/workflows/backend.yml` (36 lines) - Backend tests/build with paths filter
- `.husky/pre-commit` (13 lines) - Pre-commit hook script
- `package.json` updates (lint-staged config, husky setup)
- `docs/adr/005-precommit-hooks-and-ci-optimization.md` (246 lines)

### Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Added paths-ignore for docs

### Files Deleted (v1 Cleanup)

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Replaced by separate workflows
- `scripts/categorize-files.ts` - Custom categorization engine
- `scripts/__tests__/categorize-files.test.ts` - Tests for custom engine
- `scripts/get-changed-files.sh` - Bash helper
- `shared/src/types/file-categorization.ts` - Type definitions
- `shared/src/types/precommit-checks.ts` - Type definitions

## Testing Completed

### Pre-commit Hooks

- ✅ Commit with formatting errors blocked (Prettier auto-fixes)
- ✅ Commit with linting errors blocked (clear error messages)
- ✅ Commit with TypeScript errors blocked (clear error messages)
- ✅ Commit with passing code succeeds
- ✅ Hook auto-installation via `pnpm install` works
- ✅ Hook bypass via `--no-verify` works

### CI Workflows (v2)

- ✅ Docs-only changes skip all workflows
- ✅ Frontend changes trigger lint + frontend workflows only
- ✅ Backend changes trigger lint + backend workflows only
- ✅ Shared changes trigger lint + frontend + backend workflows
- ✅ Deploy workflow skips on docs-only changes

---

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ SC-001: Developers catch errors locally before CI (Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript)
- ✅ SC-002: Pre-commit checks complete in <60 seconds
- ✅ SC-003: Documentation-only changes skip workflows (<30 seconds)
- ✅ SC-005: Formatting/linting/type errors caught before reaching CI
- ✅ SC-006: Clear error messages when commit blocked
- ✅ SC-008: Path filters correctly identify file change categories

## Lessons Learned

1. **Platform Features First**: Always check if the platform already provides the feature before building custom solutions
2. **Simplicity Over Flexibility**: The custom categorization engine was flexible but unnecessary
3. **Question Complexity**: ~4000 lines for CI optimization is a red flag - simplify aggressively
4. **Separate Workflows**: Multiple focused workflow files are clearer than one complex file
5. **Read the Docs**: GitHub Actions `paths` documentation was there all along
